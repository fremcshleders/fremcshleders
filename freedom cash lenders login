Over the years I've noticed an abundance of payday and quick loan type businesses popping up. Generally they exist in areas where there is a larger cash economy. Often in parts of the city where folks do not have regular bank accounts, speak little English and don't trust banks, or where less than economically savvy people hang their hats. They wouldn't do well with a normal bank account because quite frankly they can't balance a check book. Whose fault is this, is there someone to blame? Why has this venue flourished while the regular banking sector taken such a hit in this last economic recession. Yes, let's discuss all this if we might.

Many years ago, I had an acquaintance who started a payday loan business and a pawn shop. I used to tease him and call him a loan-shark. He vehemently defended his establishment as just, honest, and claimed free-market status. He said he didn't hold a gun to anyone's head to bring in their personal items or take out expensive consumer loans, they did it by choice and I for one who loves freedom, liberty and choice should respect this. Yes, I understand that argument. Still, when you see too many of these types of businesses in town, well, you know; there goes the neighborhood as they say.
